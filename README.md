# basic_dynamics

Simple physical collision simulator of particles with coeffitient of restitution (defines how elastic the collision is,
which means how much kinetic energy gets 'lost' in a collision) as the main parameter. 

In the real world [e_coeff] ranges from zero (inelastic) to one (perfectly elastic).
